# Avendael Spacemacs Layer

This repo contains my spacemacs private layer and `.spacemacs` file.
[Spacemacs] is an emacs starter kit which mainly focuses on combining
vim and emacs.

## Why throw away your dotemacs?

I have decided to use spacemacs instead of my carefully curated
[dotemacs] because there are a lot of similarities between the two.
Additionally, I was able to trim down my personal configuration to a very
small set of files with very few lines of code. Spacemacs gives me a lot
of things for free because of the high quality contribution layers, and if
I come across something useful, I contribute back to the project :wink:.

## Installation

An installation script is coming up, but for now:

- Clone spacemacs somewhere
- `ln -s path/to/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d`
- Clone this repo somewhere
- `ln -s path/to/dotspacemacs/dotspacemacs ~/.spacemacs`
- `ln -s path/to/dotspacemacs/avendael ~/.emacs.d/private/`

Yup, links everywhere.

## Future work

- Installation script
- Too many to list down :wink:
